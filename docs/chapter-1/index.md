# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of Physical AI and embodied intelligence, exploring how artificial intelligence systems can be designed to interact with and understand the physical world.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Define Physical AI and distinguish it from traditional AI approaches
- Explain the concept of embodied intelligence and its significance
- Understand the layered architecture approach to Physical AI systems
- Identify the key challenges and opportunities in Physical AI research
- Recognize the relationship between perception, cognition, and action in embodied systems

## Chapter Structure

This chapter is organized as follows:

1. [Physical AI Fundamentals](./physical-ai-intro.md) - Core concepts and definitions
2. [Layered Architecture Overview](./layered-architecture.md) - Understanding the system layers
3. [References](./references.md) - Citations and sources used in this chapter

## Navigation

- **Previous**: [Introduction](../intro.md)
- **Next**: [Physical AI Fundamentals](./physical-ai-intro.md)
- **Up**: [Table of Contents](../)

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this chapter, you should have:

- Basic understanding of AI concepts (machine learning, neural networks)
- Familiarity with robotics fundamentals (kinematics, control systems)
- Knowledge of programming concepts (preferably Python or C++)

## Cross-References

This chapter establishes the foundational concepts of Physical AI and embodied intelligence. The layered architecture approach introduced here is implemented using:

- **Chapter 2**: ROS 2 as the middleware framework for implementing the layered architecture
- **Chapter 3**: Simulation environments for testing and validating Physical AI systems
- **Chapter 4**: NVIDIA Isaac for AI perception and learning components
- **Chapter 5**: Vision-Language-Action pipelines that integrate perception and action
- **Chapter 6**: Complete autonomous humanoid architecture integrating all layers

## Next Steps

After completing this chapter, you'll have a solid foundation in Physical AI concepts and be ready to explore the technical implementations in subsequent chapters, starting with ROS 2 foundations for humanoid robotics.
