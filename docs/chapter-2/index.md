# Chapter 2: ROS 2 Foundations for Humanoids

This chapter introduces the Robot Operating System (ROS 2) as the nervous system for humanoid robotics applications, exploring how ROS 2 provides the infrastructure for implementing the layered architecture discussed in Chapter 1.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Understand the role of ROS 2 in Physical AI and humanoid robotics
- Explain the architecture and core concepts of ROS 2
- Implement basic ROS 2 nodes and communication patterns
- Design humanoid-specific ROS 2 packages and interfaces
- Apply ROS 2 tools for debugging and visualization
- Integrate ROS 2 with other Physical AI components

## Chapter Structure

This chapter is organized as follows:

1. [ROS 2 Fundamentals](./ros-foundations.md) - Core concepts and architecture
2. [Humanoid-Specific ROS Implementation](./humanoid-ros.md) - Specialized implementations for humanoid robots
3. [References](./references.md) - Citations and sources used in this chapter

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this chapter, you should have:

- Basic understanding of robotics concepts (kinematics, control systems)
- Familiarity with programming concepts (preferably Python or C++)
- Understanding of the layered architecture from Chapter 1
- Basic knowledge of Linux command line

## Navigation

- **Previous**: [Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI](../chapter-1/index.md)
- **Next**: [ROS 2 Fundamentals](./ros-foundations.md)
- **Up**: [Table of Contents](../)

## Cross-References

This chapter builds on the layered architecture concept from Chapter 1 by implementing ROS 2 as the "nervous system" for Physical AI systems. The ROS 2 framework established here is used in:

- **Chapter 3**: Simulation environments that leverage ROS 2 for communication between real and virtual systems
- **Chapter 4**: NVIDIA Isaac integration with ROS 2 for AI perception and learning
- **Chapter 5**: Vision-Language-Action pipelines using ROS 2 messaging
- **Chapter 6**: Complete autonomous humanoid architecture using ROS 2 as the communication backbone

## Next Steps

After completing this chapter, you'll have a solid understanding of ROS 2 as the foundational framework for Physical AI systems and be ready to explore simulation and digital twins in Chapter 3.
